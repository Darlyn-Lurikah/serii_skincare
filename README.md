## Design

For this site, I wanted something soft and a bit playful but not too busy so it feels like a place for quality products. 


### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme is made up of soft pinks, pale blue and a deep ultramarine 

![colour scheme](docs/colour-scheme.PNG)

The colours, while not the most neutral, are still soft enought not to overwhelm the user.
I used the ultramarine for text and buttons to make them stand out. It's a better alternative to black or dark grey as it has high contrast, but still fits the brand image. 
The gold adds a touch of decadance.


### Typography
For the general font throught the site I chose [Mukta Malar](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mukta+Malar?query=mal)as it is clean, easy to read and contrast well with the brand name font

The brand font I chose is [STIX Two Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/STIX+Two+Text?query=stix)as it felt grounded but not too serious and would be good for drawing attention to various area of the site against the other simpler Mukta Malar font. 


## Wireframes and Initial Design

[Initial design idea here](docs/MS4-design.pdf)

As the project went on, the wireframe design changed do to design limiations and time constraints.
